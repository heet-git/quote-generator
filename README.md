# Website for generating quotes and sharing on Twitter

This is a website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to generate new quotes and share them on Twitter. 
The website also uses API calls and asynchronous JavaScript to provide a seamless user experience.

## How to Use

To use the website, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. Once the page has loaded, click the "New Quote" button to generate a new quote. 
You can continue to click the button to generate new quotes until you find one you like.

Once you have found a quote you would like to share on Twitter, click the "Tweet" button. 
This will open a new window with a pre-populated tweet containing the quote and the author's name.

## API

The website uses the (https://type.fit/api/quotes) to generate quotes. 
This API allows us to generate quotes and provides a large database of quotes to choose from.

To make API calls, the website uses the built-in fetch() function in JavaScript. Asynchronous JavaScript is used to ensure that the 
website remains responsive while the API call is being made.
